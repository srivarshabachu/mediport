    <h1>Basic Treatment Instructions</h1>
    <h2>ABCs of First Aid</h2>
    <p>If someone is unconscious or unresponsive, the basic principle of first aid that you need to know is ABC: airway, breathing, and circulation.</p>
    <ul>Airway: If someone’s not breathing, the first thing you need to do is clear their airway.</ul>
    <ul>Breathing: If you have cleared a person’s airway but they’re still not breathing, provide rescue breathing.</ul>
    <ul>Circulation: As you are doing rescue breathing, perform chest compressions to keep the person’s blood circulating. If the person is breathing but is not responsive, check their pulse. If their heart has stopped, provide chest compressions.</ul>

    <h2>First Aid for a Stopped Heart</h2>

   <p>&emsp; If a person’s heart is not beating, they could die. When a person is in cardiac arrest, doing CPR(Cardiopulmonary resuscitation) could save them.        </p>   
   <h3>&emsp;What to Do ?</h3>
   <p>&emsp; 1.“Call 911.”</p>
   <p>&emsp;2.Start doing chest compressions on the person who needs help. Using both your hands, push down hard and fast in the center of the person’s chest. Let their chest come &emsp; &ensp;  back up naturally between compressions. Keep going until someone with more training arrives.</p>
   <p>&emsp;3.If you’re trained in CPR, you can use chest compressions and rescue breathing.</p>

    <h3>&emsp;What to Do ?</h3>
   <p>&emsp; 1.Wash your hands or put on disposable gloves if you have them. This will protect you from infectious diseases like viral hepatitis and HIV/AIDS that can be spread in &emsp;&ensp;a person’s blood.</p>
   <p>&emsp;2.Rinse the wound with water.Cover the wound with a gauze or cloth (e.g., towel, blanket, clothing).Apply direct pressure to stop the flow of blood and encourage &emsp;&ensp;&emsp; clotting (when blood naturally thickens to stop blood loss).</p>
   <p>&emsp;3.Elevate the bleeding body part above the person’s head if you can.
    Do not remove the cloth if it becomes soaked. Removing the first layer will interfere with the &emsp;&ensp;&emsp;&emsp; clotting process and result in more blood loss. Instead, add more layers if needed.
    Once bleeding has stopped, put a clean bandage on the wound</p>

   <p>&emsp;3.Put a cold pack on the injury—but not directly on the skin. Use a barrier between the ice and the skin to keep the tissue from being damaged. If all you have is ice, put &emsp;&ensp; it in a plastic bag and wrap it in a shirt or towel before applying it.
    Give the person anti-inflammatory drugs like Advil (ibuprofen) or Aleve (naproxen) for pain.</p>
